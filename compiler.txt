Compilation from the Command Line
A MetaEditor executable file can be used as the compiler when working with a source code in external editors. The compiler is started from the command line, specifying the path and name of the file you want to compile:
metaeditor.exe /compile:"<full path to the source file>"
metaeditor64.exe /compile:"<full path to the source file>"
Example
"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\metaeditor64.exe" /compile:"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Scripts\myscript.mq5"
Mass compilation of files in a directory

For mass compilation, set the path to a folder rather than to a file. All source code files in the specified folder will be compiled. Subfolders are not included.
Re-compilation is not performed if a source file already has the appropriate compiled version.
The example below displays mass compilation for the \MQL5\Scripts folder.
Example
"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\metaeditor64.exe" /compile:"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Scripts"
Custom MQL5/MQL4 folder with include files

Programs can use additional include (*.mqh) files located outside the current platform's working folder (for example, in the \MQL5 folder of another platform copy on the same computer). Specify the path to this folder using the "/inc" key for correct compilation.
Example
"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\metaeditor64.exe" /compile:"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Scripts" /inc:"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform 2\MQL5"
Compilation log

Specify the additional /log key for more information about the compilation process. In this case, <source file name>.log compilation log file is created in the folder containing the source file.
Example
"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\metaeditor64.exe" /compile:"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Scripts\myscript.mq5" /log 
Log file: C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Script\myscript.log
Syntax check

To check a program syntax without compilation, launch MetaEditor from the command line with the /s and /log keys (so that results of the check are displayed in the log file).
Example
"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\metaeditor64.exe" /compile:"C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Scripts\myscript.mq5" /s /log 
File with the results of the check: C:\Program Files\TradingPlatform\MQL5\Script\myscript.log
